## Introduction

**Chai Aur Cohort** is a full-stack web development cohort led by  
**Hitesh Choudhary** Sir and **Piyush Garg** Sir.

This repository is created **before the official cohort begins** and is intended purely for **pre-cohort preparation and foundational discipline**.

The focus at this stage is **mindset, consistency, documentation habits, and learning readiness**, not advanced technical implementation.

---

## Purpose of This Repository

- Prepare mentally and structurally for the cohort
- Practice clean documentation and repository organization
- Build discipline around version control and consistency
- Maintain notes, learning references, and preparation material
- Enter the cohort with clarity and confidence

---

## Documentation Structure

This repository will gradually evolve and may include:

- **Notes** — Conceptual understanding and learning summaries
- **Assignments** — Practice exercises (once the cohort begins)
- **Projects** — Hands-on applications of learned concepts
- **Blogs / Learnings** — Personal reflections and insights

Structure will mature as the cohort progresses.
